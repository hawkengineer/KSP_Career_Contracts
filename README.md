# KSP_Career_Contracts

Contract Pack to help guide career gameplay.  Here are some features of the contract pack:

	- Design for probe before crew tech tree implementation
	- Design to be compatible with most planet packs and stock KSP
	- Divides missions into separate groups for ease of use in the game
	- Exploration and missions follows the normal progression within KSP


Contract Pack is still in-work, additional items that need work are:

	- Add compatibility for planet packs that add stars to the game.  
	  Currently, KSP handles all remote stars and planets as moon's around the last planet that orbits the Sun.
	- Working on new ideas for missions
	- Need to validate all contracts and funds
